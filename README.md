all inline styles bc we want to use it in outlook desktop to sure insure it works

<meta charset="UTF-8"> does not work in html signatures so we have to replace "ü" with &uuml;.

Here is a list of common German special characters and their corresponding HTML entities:

Character Description HTML Entity:

Ä Capital A with umlaut &Auml;
ä Small a with umlaut &auml;
Ö Capital O with umlaut &Ouml;
ö Small o with umlaut &ouml;
Ü Capital U with umlaut &Uuml;
ü Small u with umlaut &uuml;
ß Eszett (sharp S) &szlig;
€ Euro sign &euro;
« Left-pointing double angle quotation mark &laquo;
» Right-pointing double angle quotation mark &raquo;

These HTML entities are recognized by all modern web browsers and email clients, and using them ensures that special German characters will render correctly across different platforms.

Adding display: block; max-width: 350px; width: 350px; height: auto to the <tr> and <td> elements may not resolve the issue for a few reasons:

Table Row (<tr>) and Table Cell (<td>) Behavior: In HTML, the <tr> and <td> elements are part of the table layout structure and behave differently from block-level elements. Adding display: block to them may break their intended behavior, especially in email clients like Outlook. Tables are generally meant to display as rows and cells, and altering their display to block can cause unexpected issues.

Redundant Sizing on <tr> and <td>: Setting width and height on the <tr> and <td> won’t directly affect the image. The size of the image should be controlled through the <img> tag, not the parent table structure. Outlook may ignore these width and height styles on <tr> and <td> elements.

Outlook’s Handling of CSS: While inline styles on elements like <img> are usually effective, adding styles to <tr> and <td> may be less reliable in Outlook, as its rendering engine doesn't always honor complex CSS rules for tables.

What You Should Do Instead:
Focus on styling the <img> directly rather than modifying the table structure. The best way to control the image size is by setting the width and height on the image itself, not on the <tr> or <td>. Here's a simplified version of what I recommend:

html
Copy code

<tr>
    <td>
        <img
            src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/..."
            width="350"
            style="
                display: block;
                max-width: 350px;
                width: 350px;
                height: auto;
            "
            alt="Team Kernstock Logo"
        />
    </td>
</tr>
Why This Makes Sense:
Tables Render Correctly: The table will maintain its expected structure and behavior, without forcing block-level display rules that may break in email clients.
Image Sizing Control: The image’s width is explicitly defined as 350px, and the height will scale automatically to maintain the aspect ratio.
Let me know how this works! If the problem persists, we may need to explore using VML for more control over images in Outlook.
